                        <p class="faq-q">What is Trippki?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki is an ecosystem application that revolutionises the hotel booking industry by disintermediating existing OTA (Online Travel Agent) models. Trippki takes a crypto-economic approach to incentivise the direct sharing of value between hotels and the customer. By using the platform customers earn TRIP Token, a crypto-asset based loyalty reward.</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">For the customer Trippki is a familiar user interface of a hotel booking platform, yet with much better deals in terms of rewards and promotions.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Technical Platform">
                        <p class="faq-q">Who is building the Trippki Software?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">The Trippki team has a mix of expertise across OTA software, decentralised technology and payment systems. Dapphub (the team behind Maker DAO) are building the Token Contract and are advising on the Smart Contract infrastructure. Our in house technical team are the primary architects and developers for the reward, payment system and front end application and will work with contracted third parties as required.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Project Technical">
                        <p class="faq-q">Why are you building on the Blockchain?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Online hotel booking is a classic example of a market that heavily relies on intermediaries. This creates overheads at the expense of customers and businesses, while third parties profit. This is what Blockchain technology was designed to disrupt.</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Blockchain technology allows the creation of a decentralised digital economy that doesn’t rely on a third party to function. That magical innovation allows for our protocol/token, TRIP, to be a non-dilutive alternative to traditional loyalty rewards schemes, while allowing value to be shared amongst the eco-system participants.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Technical Platform">
                        <p class="faq-q">Why Ethereum?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Ethereum provides the most mature infrastructure and tools for building complex DApps and has a strong community of developers working to continually improve the ecosystem. Ethereum is not trivial to work with, but our team has an understanding of how to make the best use of the infrastructure having followed the project since it’s inception.</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki will always run on top of Ethereum, yet as new decentralised application platforms come along (i.e. EOS, DFinity) we will consider integrating with them only if it improves the Trippki ecosystem.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Project Technical">
                        <p class="faq-q">Is your product decentralised?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki is an open protocol and is designed to evolve into a fully decentralised autonomous economy. TRIP token is fully decentralised from the start, as well as other fundamental components. To bootstrap the system some of the transactions will be processed on servers including fiat transactions to ensure wide adoption. During the bootstrapping phase we make sure that all the off chain components are incentivised to act honest, and have no way to manipulate the system. For more information read the architecture section of the WP. Initially the UI is hosted centrally but once the MVP is out releasing Swarm and IPFS versions is on our roadmap.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">What is the difference between Trippki and other reward token schemes?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Whereas traditional reward points are inflexible and difficult to redeem, TRIP tokens are a cryptographically secure and decentralised token that are redeemable at the holder’s discretion.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Project">
                        <p class="faq-q">What is the difference between Trippki and Travelcoin or Winding Tree?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki supports any decentralised project associated with Travel that supports the ecosystem. All of the teams building decentralised solutions for travel industry are doing very important work, all are covering different areas.</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">For example, apart from differences in crypto-economic design - Winding Tree is not planning to deliver a user facing product, and expect third party engineers to build on top. We believe that a good UI is a cornerstone of wider adoption of the system. And the adoption is necessary to make the economics work.</p>

                      <div class="element-item Token">
                        <p class="faq-q">Is there a pre-sale?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Yes, there is a pre-sale and a whitelist. For detailed pre-sale conditions see the Token Sale Summary on github or ping us on Slack.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Token">
                        <p class="faq-q">Will Trippki tokens be traded on exchanges?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Due to its decentralised nature, there’s nothing to prevent any token holder from transferring TRIP token freely and release it on the secondary market. Once the system is operational the reward system will buy TRIP from the open market.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Token Distribution">
                        <p class="faq-q">How can I participate in the Trippki Token distribution?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">You will need to send ETH to the official Ethereum smart contract address set forth during the distribution window. Don’t send any ETH from exchanges, and only send ETH from an address that you have full control over.</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Only send ETH to the official smart contract address, make sure it comes from the official Trippki source - website. We are taking all precautions against phishing attacks, but it is still recommended to stay vigilant and do double-check this address against Etherscan before sending ETH. Beware of the fact that the contract address WILL NOT be released any time before the token sale period.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="element-item Project Token Platform">
                        <p class="faq-q">How much are you planning to raise?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">$6.5M- $9M. The project doesn’t have a minimum cap. We have set a Hard Cap of $9M to allow participants to take full advantage of pre-sale bonus discounts while still providing Trippki with enough funds to develop and launch the solution. Note that all the amounts in fiat are given for indicative purposes, the caps will be locked in ETH prior to the token launch and based on the ETH price average prior to the sale.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Which currency do you accept for the token launch?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">We only accept ETH. Holders of other cryptocurrencies can easily convert to ETH with services such as Shapeshift https://shapeshift.io or Changelly https://changelly.com/ for a small fee. Conversion might take time, so ensure that you get your ETH in advance.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Do I have to be an accredited investor for the Pre-ICO?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">You do not need to be an accredited investor (since TRIP token is not an investment) to participate, however a minimum of approx amount $5,000 [in ETH] is required.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">What wallet should I use?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">TRIP is Ethereum based so you can use any Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20. We recommend MEW (MyEtherWallet) or Metamask - both are very easy to use. We also recommend Hardware wallets such as Trezor, Ledger and Keepkey. More advanced users are of course welcome to use their favourite Ethereum implementation.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">Jaxx will not display TRIP token balances. Use the wallets we have recommended. However if you do send ETH to Trippki token sale contract from Jaxx, follow their instructions on how to export your keys. You will see your TRIP balance and will be able to use your TRIP after uploading those keys to a recommended wallet. Please, keep your private keys secret &amp; take care of the passwords from the private keys you keep encrypted.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Can I use Exodus wallet?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Please, use recommended wallets. Exodus is not open source (which means it’s security can’t be publicly audited) and requires a registration.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">Unfortunately residents and entities based in the US, Iran and N.Korea are excluded from purchasing Trippki Tokens during the token distribution. This applies to US citizens, in part, due to the logistical challenges associated with differing regulations in the many states of the United States of America.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">TRIP is a functional token that powers the Trippki reward system. TRIP Tokens finite supply and burn mechanism, create economic incentives to reward participation. TRIP token value comes from the access to a cost-efficient universal loyalty points travel economy.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">Absolutely! As a matter of fact it’s what we find extremely exciting about the TRIP protocol. Its decentralised nature makes it unstoppable and could plug into any application in need of a global reputation and reward ledger.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">The Trippki reward protocol has been designed to scale. But we are aware of questions regarding Ethereum’s own scalability. Trippki project is planning to put a proportion of funds and available skill into researching and contributing to the development of scalability solutions (i.e. TrueBit, Raiden) as well as working on in house payment channel implementations.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki is architecture has many components and interactions that can be approached from a variety of perspectives. For higher level explanation see the Architecture Overview on the website or alternatively come to one of the meetups we’re presenting at. We are constantly releasing content that explains the system in more depth. Don’t hesitate to ping one of our team members in Slack and we walk you through it.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Will Trippki charge commission in the same way as other OTA’s?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">No that is not our model. Initially, for hotels that use the Trippki UI there will be a service fee of 2.5%, which is dramatically lower than any other OTA platform. We can work with this level of fee due to the crypto-economic approach incentives of the TRIP Reward System. As the system generates network effect we want to reduce this fee towards zero.</p>

                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki’s customers will receive TRIP loyalty rewards. The value of the overall transaction is equivalent the price agreed by hotels with other OTA’s and hence does not break price parity agreements.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">How will Trippki compete with the likes of Booking.com and Expedia?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki has a deep passion towards creating a better relationship between hotels and their customers. Through the economic incentivisation of TRIP Rewards we believe that we can create a network effect and take market share away from existing OTA’s</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">How will consumers know that Trippki exists to book on?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Our ethos is crypto-economics and incentivisation that will create the desired network economy. But we will also use funds raised in crowdsale towards marketing during the bootstrap phase and have set aside a significant portion of TRIP as bounties for this purpose.</p>

                      <div class="element-item Market">
                        <p class="faq-q">Trippki doesn’t have $4 billion dollars of advertising revenues, so how will it be effective in advertising the hotels to guests?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">We believe in economically incentivising our main counterparts; the hotels and their customers. Our loyalty token, TRIP, is open and permissionless, therefore it incentivises players from many different industries to use as a complementary scheme. Making TRIP more valuable as and when more people use it.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Is Trippki similar to Airbnb?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Trippki is not similar to Airbnb. Our driver of demand is the distribution of TRIP, making sure that all counterparts are incentivised proportionally. We believe that a token based economy will allow for a fairer resource allocation and therefore will liberate hotels as well as individuals.</p>

                        <p class="faq-q">Do the hotels need to understand anything about cryptocurrencies generally to use Trippki?</p>
                        <p class="faq-a">Hotels need no understanding of cryptocurrencies to participate on the Trippki platform. Hotels will be able to use platform to tailor specific deals to guests based on their reputation.</p>
