                    <p>Contributors are aware of the many risk involved in the purchase, use and sale of tokens and the token sale process. We have outlined below some of the material risks that are obvious to the Company and persons involved in the Token Sale and Network project (including Released Parties):</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-1">
                    <p>1.1</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Early Stage Technology</strong>The Token will be used to develop a Network that is based on or in some way  involved with distributed ledger technologies (DLT). You understand and accept that the use of DLT Tokenised stores of value is highly experimental. Participation in the proposed Token Sale and Network project therefore represents a very high risk to Contributors. The Token Issuing Entity will invest in software and other technologies and that in all cases these technologies and businesses will still be in an early development stage and unproven, and there is an inherent risk that the software, technologies and related businesses invested in by the Token Issuing Entity could be unfit for their intended purpose and/or not have the value expected.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-1">
                    <p>1.2</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Cryptocurrency.</strong>The Token Issuing Entity may wish to store or convert cryptocurrency contributions into one or more fiat and/or alternative cryptocurrencies and there could be significant difficulties in making and managing such cryptocurrencies and funds including relating to the lack of ready convertibility between fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and Tokens and the difficulty in being able to deal with such assets via traditional market counterparties and intermediaries. If the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuate unfavourably during or after the Token Sale, we may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that is intended. In addition to the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could exacerbate the risk of unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to another DAO-like attack on the Ethereum network; or significant security incidents or market irregularities at one or more of the major cryptocurrency exchanges.

                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Main Protocol.</strong>Many of the Network project technologies including the Token will, at least initially, be based on the Bitcoin and the Ethereum protocols. Any malfunction, breakdown, forking or abandonment of these protocols may have a material adverse effect on the Network or the Tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present fundamental risks to the value of such protocols and the Network.</p>

                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Risk of software weaknesses: </strong>You understand and accept that the Network and the Tokens, the Contribution software and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven, and there is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software, Network, Tokens and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the partial or complete: loss of Tokens; inability to use Tokens; and/or lack of usefulness of Tokens. </p>

                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Risk of blockchain mining attacks:</strong>You understand and accept that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the Network may be susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Tokens transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Risk of loss of your credentials:</strong>You understand and accept that if your Wallet credentials are lost or stolen, the obtained Tokens associated with the Contribution will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your Wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your Wallet will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted Wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the Wallet you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such Wallet, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth herein for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Wallet address, or provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.

                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Cybercrime.</strong>The acquisition and management of cryptocurrencies and Tokens is inherently subject to the risk of cybercrime that is difficult to manage and mitigate. This may result in concerted attempts and even successful attempts to hack the Network, Token Sale and the Sites and software used to manage contributions received in respect of Tokens and other software or technology components and to defraud Contributors and the Token Issuing Entity. The Token Issuing Entity and the Token Sale may be subject unauthorised access, hacking and/or theft of some of cryptocurrency and Token assets and it may not be possible to successfully insure against the same at a reasonable price or at all. The Token Issuing Entity is not required to insure the assets of the Token Issuing Entity and does not intend to insure the same. Any unauthorised access or cybercrime may result in theft or loss or inability to access Contributions, impacting the ability to issue Tokens and/or develop and launch the Network.

                  <div class="col-11">
                    <p><strong>Failure or Abandonment.</strong>The Token Sale event itself or the Network project may be fully or partially abandoned or required to be re-structured for a number of reasons or remain technologically or commercially unsuccessful, or be shut down for many reasons including e.g., lack of interest from industry and/or the public, changes in law or regulatory issues, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that any Tokens or rights to Token acquired by Contributors will have the value expected or any value at the time of realisation. You therefore understand and accept that the Contribution and/or the allocation, use and ownership of Tokens, carries significant risks that could lead to the Tokens being unusable or valueless particularly as a means to exchange information and services with other Network participants.</p>

                    <p><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong>You understand and accept that DLT and blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Contribution process and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Network, including potential loss of Tokens for the Contributor. Further, the Contributor accepts and bears risks with respect to US-regulations that may regulate Contribution and/or potential custody of Tokens including for US persons. The Token Issuing Entity or any Group Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

                    <p><strong>Risk of uninsured losses:</strong>Tokens do not represent deposits and are not subject to any statutory or private insurance unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by X, to offer recourse to you.</p>

                    <p><strong>Risk of governance failure:</strong>Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company, all decisions involving Company’s products or services or that of any subsidiary company within the Network or the Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue its products or services on the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the utility of any Tokens you own.</p>
